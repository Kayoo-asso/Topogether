## Global TODO
- For each object, investigate which initialization options can be modified just using a `.set()` method and which require deleting + recreating the object
- Fix `active` for Interaction
- Open issue + pull request for Select:
  - add option to remove all features not at clicked location when specifying any of add/remove/toggle conditions
  - subscribe to feature removals in underlying source
