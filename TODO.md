- Adapt Supabase Auth setup for offline use (currently: disconnected after long period offline + infinite loops of token refreshes)
- Wrap the remaining `fetch` calls with `try` / `catch` to handle network errors (example: ImageService)
- ImageService fails in my Firefox due to CORS
- Custom `signUp` endpoint that uses `client.auth.api.createUser()` to detect accounts with duplicate emails
    -> could check for duplicate userNames at the same time
